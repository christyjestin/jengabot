        "The purpose of this project was to understand Rader's Fast Fourier Transformation algorithim from two angles. The first approach was to explore the number theory behind the technique and understand how exactly a DFT can be expressed as a convolution and how the relatiosnhip to the group $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{x}$ helps us to decompose the computation. The second approach was to implement Rader's Algorithim in Python, so that we could compute some examples and show that Rader's Algorithim is orders of magnitude better than a naive implementation. I developed a deeper understanding of groups, Fourier transformations, and the order of algorithims.\n"

        "# **INTRODUCTION**\n",
        "The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers lists the FFT as one of the ten most important algorithims of the 20th century. [1] The FFT is uqbiquitous across disciplines from straigtforward applications to signal processing to use in convolutional neural networks. Rader's algorithim was the first of a class of FFT methods that allowed the decomposition of prime length sequences [3].\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadly, the goal of Fourier Transform is to decompose a signal into a sum of periodic functions (here sines and cosines with different frequencies). Often mathemticians think of Fourier transformations as mappings of a continuous function from a  time domain to a frequency domain. Here, since computers work best with discrete data, we'll consider a fourier transformation as mapping a set of N sampled points from a time domain to a set of N points in a frequency domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This process of decomposition turns out to be extremly computationally intensive. A naive implementation requries on the order of $N^2$ multiplications alone [2]. For a tool used everywhere (radios, televisions, etc.), this level of inefficiency is impractical.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest algorithims (e.g., Cooley-Tukey) are \"divide and conquer\" algorithims [2]. They work when N is a composite number. In particular, Cooley-Tukey subidvides N into its prime factors and cleverly sums their DFTs resulting in an algorithim on the order of $Nlog(N)$. However, when N is prime, no such divide and conquor method is possible. [2]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This is precisely the problem that Rader's algorithim solves. Instead of decomposing N into a product, it treats a fourier transformation as a (discrete) convolution, instead. The sequences convolved are carefully chosen and indexed to maximize computational efficiency. The indexing of these two sequences (which will be explored in much greater depth later) is chosen according to the group generator of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{x}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, I detail the number theory that makes this possible and offer a few proofs for the key points that allow this. I also work through one small example by hand, illustrating for a small p that Rader's method results in the same output as the naive impelmetation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "I then move to the implementation of the algorithim, offering first a *very* naive fourier transformation. I compare that to built in methods. I then implement Rader's algorithim and its accompnaying helper functions. I show for a series of examples that it's both much faster than the naive implementation.\n"

        "If I had the chance to do this project over again, I'd change the language I programmed in. While Python is the language I'm most comfortable with, I now  understand why I didn't find anyone else implementing Rader's method (or any DFT designed for efficiency) using it. While the code is readable and very closely related to the computations I performed, it's not the most efficient. While I'm very glad I was able to get within two orders of magnitude of the built-in method, I think I would have been able to do much better using a language designed for efficiency where more vectorization is possible. I'd also spend more time optimizing my helper functions, which I think are slowing down the process quite a bit. I wish I had a chance to implement zero-padding to the nearest power of two and compare that directly to the pure Rader FFT. In that scenario, I'd also have ideally liked to write my own Cooley-Tukey method, so that I could avoid using any built ins, and compute Rader's Method with Zero Padding using only my own code. It would have been really interesting to compare that to the built in method to see how much my helper functions are slowing me down.\n",

        "# Lingering Questions\n",
        "Since this took almost exactly as much time as I expected, there's nothing that I intended to do that hasn't worked yet. However, the two things that I mentioned in my proposal that I didn't think I'd have time to implement (and didn't) but still want to explore more are Bluestein's method and proving analytically that when zero-padded optimally, Rader's Algorithim is $O(NlogN)$.I'd also work a little more on more modern implementations of FFTs, especially the Chirp-Z transform and learn more about non-fourier time frequency transformations, like the Laplace transform. In some of the litterature I've read, they mentioned a hardware implementation of the FFT, which I'd love to learn more about [6]. I still don't think I really understand in general how we go from a physical signal to something a computer takes in to a data set Rader's algorithim acts upon.\n",
