For example, let's think of a dynamical system as given by the difference equation: $$x[n+1] = f(n, x[n], u[n]),$$ where $n$ is the \"time\", $x$ is the state, and $u$ is any inputs to the system.  The `System` describes $f()$, but we use a structure called the [`Context`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_context.html) to hold the runtime values: $n, x, u$.  We use a structure, because some systems have even more runtime values, that describe system parameters, random noise inputs, etc, and it is cleaner to pass a structure around than have each system accept a different list of possible inputs.  As a rule `System` is constant over the duration of a simulation, and you should be able to obtain repeatable, deterministic simulations given any value `Context`.\n","\n","Let's see what the

Visualizing the scene\n","\n","The best way to visualize the results of a physics engine is with a 2D or 3D visualizer. For that, we need to add the system which curates the geometry of a scene (the geometry engine); in Drake with call it the [`SceneGraph`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html). Once we have a `SceneGraph`, then there are a number of different visualizers and sensors that we can add to the system to actually render the scene.\n","\n","We support a number of visualizers in drake (we ship a simple VTK-based \"drake-visualizer\" with our binary releases, or you can use RViz).  But because we're working in a jupyter notebook, and want you to be able to run 3D graphics on any machine without any installation required, we'll use the [MeshCat](https://github.com/rdeits/meshcat) visualizer throughout these notes.  \n","\n","To use all three systems (`MultibodyPlant`, `SceneGraph`, and `MeshcatVisualizer`), we need to assemble them into a [`Diagram`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_diagram.html) using a [`DiagramBuilder`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_diagram_builder.html).  Often you would add each system and then connect the ports together, but for common cases like we have here, we provide helper methods to reduce the boilerplate."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"cell_id":"d9b01e1e8611417d80b5e6cc9a0c5db1","colab":{},"colab_type":"code","deepnote_cell_type":"code","id":"WkfjAgrL1Dh-"},"outputs":[],"source":["meshcat.Delete()\n","meshcat.DeleteAddedControls()\n","builder = DiagramBuilder()\n","\n","# Adds both MultibodyPlant and the SceneGraph, and wires them together.\n","plant, scene_graph = AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(builder, time_step=1e-4)\n","# Note that we parse into both the plant and the scene_graph here.\n","Parser(plant, scene_graph).AddModelsFromUrl(\n","    \"package://drake/manipulation/models/franka_description/urdf/panda_arm_hand.urdf\"\n",")\n","plant.WeldFrames(plant.world_frame(), plant.GetFrameByName(\"panda_link0\"))\n","plant.Finalize()\n","\n","# Adds the MeshcatVisualizer and wires it to the SceneGraph.\n","visualizer = MeshcatVisualizer.AddToBuilder(builder, scene_graph, meshcat)\n","\n","diagram = builder.Build()\n","diagram.set_name(\"plant and scene_graph\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"a1b162d4c24d4d5691979d2e2566d7a5","colab_type":"text","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"Rm4kVRMS1DiF"},"source":["If you click on the link above, you can open a browser window to see the visualization.\n","\n","But the scene will be empty so far.
