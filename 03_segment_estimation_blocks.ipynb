    "\n",
    "Object segmentation is a fundamental component of practically every end-to-end manipulation system. Several cameras will be used to prevent occlusion and partial views. We will likely use a neural network for point cloud segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the individual blocks are segmented, their unique position, orientation, and velocity of each block must be estimated. Geometric pose estimation will be used to obtain the positions and orientations. Velocity estimation is not crucial because the blocks are nearly always static unless the tower is toppling."
